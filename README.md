# Urban Hipster - Commerce 2 & Drupal 8 Demo

This is a full __Commerce 2__ demo website built on __Drupal 8__. It has been built for 3 reasons:

1. So that people can view, interact and login to an actual working demo site.
2. So that developers can install, trial and review code and configuration.
3. So that the community can see and discuss what Drupal Commerce includes basically out of-the-box.

__NOTE:__ This is __NOT__ intended to be a base for building a new project, for that we recommend generating your own composer files yourself or use the [Commerce Kickstart](https://www.commercekickstart.com).

## Welcome!

The Urban Hipster demo site has been designed, built and maintained by [__Acro Media Inc.__](https://www.acromedia.com) in order to showcase a working demo of Commerce 2 on Drupal 8. Our goal is to provide an enterprise level example of what can be done out-of-the-box with general software configuration and theming. 

__Please understand that while we strive to keep the site and its components updated to the latest versions, there may be times where we lag behind a bit.__

If you notice any bugs, please submit an issue. Weâ€™ll do our best to keep on top of things.
